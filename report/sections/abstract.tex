    Accurate and automated chicken counting in poultry farms is essential for efficient livestock management, production planning, and animal welfare monitoring. This work presents a reproduction and implementation of the Pyramid Vision Transformer (PVT) based approach for density-estimation-based chicken counting, as proposed in the Sensors 2024 paper "Transforming Poultry Farming." The architecture combines a PVT-v2-B2 backbone with Pyramid Feature Aggregation (PFA) and Multi-Scale Dilated Convolution (MDC) head to generate high-resolution density maps. Training employs a curriculum loss combining counting loss, optimal transport loss, and total variation regularization. The implementation achieves a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 0.78 chickens and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 1.09 on a test set of 147 images, demonstrating robust performance for practical deployment in commercial poultry facilities.
