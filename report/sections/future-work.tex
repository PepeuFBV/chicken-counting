\section{Future Work}

Several promising directions could extend this work and address current limitations:

\subsection{Model Improvements}

\subsubsection{Multi-Scale Inference}

Rather than resizing all images to 256×256, a multi-scale testing strategy could:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Process images at multiple resolutions (e.g., 256, 384, 512)
    \item Average predictions across scales
    \item Preserve fine-grained details in high-resolution images
    \item Improve accuracy on images with small or distant chickens
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Lightweight Architectures}

For edge deployment (on-device cameras), exploring efficient models:

\begin{itemize}
    \item PVT-v2-B0 or B1 (smaller variants) for reduced parameters
    \item Knowledge distillation from current model to compact student
    \item Quantization (INT8) and pruning for faster inference
    \item MobileViT or EfficientFormer alternatives
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Training Enhancements}

\subsubsection{Semi-Supervised Learning}

Reduce annotation burden by leveraging unlabeled data:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Self-training with pseudo-labels on unlabeled images
    \item Contrastive learning for feature representation
    \item Active learning to select most informative samples for annotation
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Dataset Expansion}

\subsubsection{Multi-Farm Dataset}

Collect data from diverse poultry farms to improve generalization:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Different chicken breeds (broilers, layers, heritage breeds)
    \item Varying farm sizes (small-scale to industrial)
    \item Multiple camera setups (overhead, side-view, multi-view)
    \item Different time periods (morning/afternoon/evening lighting)
    \item Seasonal variations (summer/winter conditions)
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Density Heatmap Analysis}

Leverage spatial density information:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Identify overcrowded regions for welfare interventions
    \item Analyze spatial distribution patterns (clustering, dispersion)
    \item Optimize feeder and water placement based on occupancy
    \item Detect environmental issues (ventilation, heating zones)
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Predictive Analytics}

Use counting data for forecasting:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Predict mortality rates from population trends
    \item Forecast feed consumption based on flock size
    \item Estimate growth rates and harvest timing
    \item Optimize stocking density for welfare and productivity
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Cross-Domain Transfer}

\subsubsection{Other Livestock}

Adapt the system to other animals:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Sheep counting in pastures (outdoor, complex backgrounds)
    \item Cattle monitoring in feedlots
    \item Pig counting in indoor facilities
    \item Fish counting in aquaculture (underwater environments)
\end{itemize}
